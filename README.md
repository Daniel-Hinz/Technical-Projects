# Kent-State-Greek-Life-Website
# This was a project I completed with a group in my introduction to database design class.

# Please note this was my first ever experience using HTML and CSS which is why it may appear to be sloppy or unorganized.
# I have included the links to all the pages, however you will not be able to view any of the tables or lists, 
# as you do not have access to the database that we created.
